🚀 SmartCRM — Business Analytics & Management Platform
SmartCRM is an intelligent, multi-tenant customer relationship management (CRM) and business analytics platform. It is engineered for growing teams (10–200 employees) to manage high-density sales pipelines, track customer interactions, and aggregate real-time business health metrics without the bloat of enterprise legacy systems.
🏗️ System Architecture
The platform utilizes a decoupled, feature-first modular architecture, ensuring strict data isolation, high-performance query execution, and a scalable foundation for future Machine Learning integrations.
Core Tech Stack
Frontend: React 18 + Tailwind CSS + Zustand (Planned for Phase 4)
Backend API Gateway: Node.js + Express.js
Database Layer: PostgreSQL (Raw parameterized queries via pg pool)
Caching & Queues: Redis (ioredis) + BullMQ
Security: JWT (Access/Refresh Token Rotation) + bcrypt hashing
🗺️ Project Milestones Achieved
Phase 1: Architectural Foundation
System Blueprints: Mapped comprehensive High-Level Design (HLD) and critical user journey data flows.
Technical Decisions: Locked in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) for PostgreSQL, Redis, and JWT session handling.
Multi-Tenancy Plan: Designed row-level tenant isolation via org_id to ensure absolute data privacy across distinct business accounts.
Phase 2: Database Engine
Schema Design: Implemented a highly relational PostgreSQL schema covering organizations, users, customers, leads, deals, and tasks.
Performance Tuning: Applied extensive indexing strategies (e.g., composite indexes on org_id and foreign keys) for rapid aggregation.
Deterministic Seeding: Created an idempotent development seed script generating realistic, relational mock data for testing Kanban pipelines and revenue funnels.
Phase 3: Backend API & Security
Authentication Core: Built a stateless JWT auth engine with Redis-backed refresh token rotation, session invalidation, and bcrypt cryptographic hashing.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Integrated dynamic middleware enforcing strict permission matrixes (super_admin, business_admin, manager, employee).
Feature Modules (CRUD): * Customers: Paginated portfolios with dynamic ILIKE search capabilities.
Leads & Pipeline: Transaction-bound Kanban stage movements (BEGIN/COMMIT) ensuring atomic updates and activity logging.
Analytics Telemetry: Complex SQL aggregations processing revenue trends, active lead counts, and global conversion rates directly at the database layer.

🛣️ Core API Routes
All endpoints are prefixed with /api/v1/ and enforce org_id multi-tenant boundaries.
Authentication
POST /auth/register — Provision new user
POST /auth/login — Issue Access & Refresh Tokens
POST /auth/refresh — Rotate tokens via Redis verification
GET /auth/me — Fetch protected session context
CRM Operations (Requires Bearer Token)
GET /customers — Paginated list with ?search= filters
PATCH /leads/:id/stage — Move lead through Kanban pipeline (Atomic)
GET /leads/stages — Retrieve organization's pipeline columns
GET /tasks — Fetch tasks filtered by ?assigned_to= or ?status=
🛠️ Local Development Setup
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
Node.js (v20+)
PostgreSQL (v15+)
Redis (v7+)
2. Database Initialization
Create the database and run the schema and seed scripts:
Bash
# Enter your PostgreSQL CLI
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE smartcrm_dev;"

# Apply schema and seed data
psql -U postgres -d smartcrm_dev -f database/schema.sql
psql -U postgres -d smartcrm_dev -f database/seeds/dev-seed.sql
3. Environment Configuration
Navigate to the backend directory and configure your secrets:
Bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
Update the .env file with your local database/Redis URIs and generate secure random strings for your JWT secrets.
4. Boot the Server
Install dependencies and start the Express gateway:
Bash
npm install
npm run dev
The server will initialize the connection pools and listen on http://localhost:3000.
